## Data

Data sample entities are in `src/data/` path.

There are 3 'data categories':

* `chart/` - testing data samples for different chart types.
* `story/` - small data samples with some business story embedded in them.
* `url/` - remote large classic datasets via URL.

These data sample entities can be grouped in different ways. The grouping structure is in `src/group/` path.
